Overview

This project is a Next.js-based homepage for Nakshatra TechnoHub. The goal was to create a well-structured, modular, and responsive design that allows easy updates and modifications to individual sections without affecting others.

Approach

1. Component-Based Architecture

The homepage is divided into multiple components to ensure a maintainable and scalable structure. Each section is built as an independent component, allowing seamless layout and content updates without interfering with other sections. The main sections include:

<Navigation />

<Empower />

<About />

<Council />

<Happening />

<Member />

<Stories />

<News />

<Donate />

<Contact />

<Footer />

2. Reusable Components

Wherever possible, I have implemented reusable components for elements like cards. This ensures consistency in UI design and allows easy modifications across different sections.

3. Next.js Optimization

Used Next.js Image component for optimized image rendering, which improves performance.


4. Mobile-Responsive Design

Responsive homepage for mobile
